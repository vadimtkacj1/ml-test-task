# Unet for Ship Segmentation

I am using the famous UNet architecture for segmenting ships from an image. For the person segmentation, we are going to use the person segmentation dataset. U-Net is built for Biomedical Image Segmentation. It is the base model for any segmentation task. It follows an encoder-decoder approach. It used skip connection to get the local information during downsampling path and use it during the upsampling path.
